----------

Type safe function pointer
method signature must match the delegate.
Delegate is reference type.

Uses:
1) Event Handling
2) Multi-threading
3) LINQ--- Lambda 

Types:
1) Unicast----- a delegate that points to a single method/function
	Unicast delegate return type can be primitive type.

2) Multicast----a delegate that points to multiple methods.
	Multicast delegate return type is always void.


Declaration of Delegate:

1) Inside the class-----  u have to call it via the object of the class 

2) Outside the class---- u can use that delegate in the whole namespace 
and directly create object of the delegate without creating object of the class.
